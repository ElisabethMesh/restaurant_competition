# Restaurant competition

## Project Information

In this project, you can take part in the evaluation of restaurants for the competition. Browse the participants, check out their menu and choose the one you like. 
You can change your vote no later than the control time. By default, 11 am is used. The rating of restaurants is made up of the number of users who voted.

There are two types of users: admin and user. Only the admin can add and manage restaurants, including changing the menu of restaurants. 
A user can only manage their account and vote for their favorite restaurant.
